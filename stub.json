The class should have the following features:\n\n1. A constructor (`__init__`) that takes a NumPy array representing a 3D image and a tuple of three numerical items for voxel dimensions.\n\n2. Define a local image coordinate system and pre-compute the voxel coordinates in the constructor. Include a brief comment describing this coordinate system.\n\n3. A member function named `volume_resize` that takes a three-item tuple specifying the resize ratio. This function should return an object of the `Image3D` class. Implement this function using `scipy.interpolate.interpn` with a trilinear method.","md5":"8cfc820381b81a09bed1a8f307fa78b9"}]}
